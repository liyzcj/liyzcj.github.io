**About me**

Welcome to my blog, my name is Liyanzhe and Alex in english. I'm a student in Bucharest now. Now I'm learning Artificial Intellegence here. AI is a magical technology, learning it makes me happy ^-^!

I like programming. In fact, What I really like is creation. Code is just a tool to implement our minds. I also like playing game, Fitness, watching movie, watching series and novel stuff. Like a newborn baby, I'm curious to everything new.

I like Linux, I use zsh and vim, but if you use emacs, we can also be frinds. Like I prefer C++, but I also don't hate java :). Every language has its own charm. 

**About This Website**

This is my first blog, At least a formal one. I plan to construct my own blog long time ago. Before this I also tried some write some simple blog, but unfortunately, I'm not good at writing. So this blog will be a study blog for a long time.

我既没有学富五车，也不是技术大牛。所以本博客在长时间内将是一个技术学习博客，可能偶尔会吐吐槽。我也是有文字梦想的人，万一有一天实现了呢。
